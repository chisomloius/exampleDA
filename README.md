# Learning DataViz Now !
<hr>
Like every great skills, learning `python visulisation or business intelligent tools` can be very demanding and brain-nerving at least for many like myself. 
For attaining professional status, the stakes are higher, so I hope this [repo](). It was made for documentation purposes but sharing them for any purpose such as teaching, learning or developing better things is a welcome solution. You can find a simplified [Doc text]() if you wnat to study from multiple sources.


## Installations
Here are some tools you will need to start learning python
- [Python Interpreter]()
- [Anaconda]()
- [IDEs]()
- [PowerBI]()
- [Excel Spreadsheet]()
- [GoogleSpreadsheet]()

## Modules
This learning modules are divided mainly into two: learn & Practice notebooks. 
The  introduces the concepts with some code examples and the the latter help you practice by doing more abstarct things:
